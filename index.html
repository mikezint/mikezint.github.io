            <h2>Hello, there! Welcome to the JellyBean Squad's official website!</h2>
            
            <h3>About our squad</h3>
            <p>
                The JellyBean Squad was formed sometime in 2017 and was based on a game called 
                ToonTown Rewritten (TTR for short). Since then, many TTR players have become 
                members of the Squad, played together and had lots of fun. However, it was 
                eventually disbanded and the Discord server used by the members was abandoned. 
                Assi then created a new server, with a bunch of new members. The JellyBean Squad 
                now lives on as the Diggy Bick Appreciation Server, a server whose members call 
                themselves cunts (or thots)... 
                <a href="history.html">Find out more in History.</a>
            </p>
            
            <h3>About the members/cunts</h3>
            <p>
                While the original JellyBean Squad consisted of 8 (and possibly 9) cunts, the 
                Diggy Bick Appreciation Server numbers 14 cunts. They are the following: ...  
                <a href="members.html">Find out more in Members.</a> 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Our Squad pictures</h3>
            <p>
                You can find images of each JellyBean Squad cunt, as well as group photos, in 
                <a href="pics.html">Images</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Our Squad's merchandise</h3>
            <p>
                Yup, it's a thing! Just head to <a href="merch.html">Merch</a> and look around. :)
