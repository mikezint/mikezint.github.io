        <h2>Hello, there! Welcome to the JellyBean Squad's official website!</h2>
        <h3>About our squad</h3>
        <p>
            The JellyBean Squad was formed sometime in 2017 and was based on a game called 
            ToonTown Rewritten (TTR for short). Since then, many TTR players have become 
            members of the Squad, played together and had lots of fun. However, it was 
            eventually disbanded and the Discord server used by the members was abandoned. 
            Assi then created a new server, with a bunch of new members. The JellyBean Squad 
            now lives on as the Diggy Bick Appreciation Server, a server whose members call 
            themselves cunts (or thots)...

            While the original JellyBean Squad consisted of 8 (and possibly 9) cunts, the 
            Diggy Bick Appreciation Server numbers 14 cunts. They are the following: ...
